Description: Researchers carried out a series of experiments passing a number 
  of essays to different GPT detection models. Juxtaposing detector predictions 
  for papers written by native and non-native English writers, the authors argue 
  that GPT detectors disproportionately classify real writing from non-native 
  English writers as AI-generated.
